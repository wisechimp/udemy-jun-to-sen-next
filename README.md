This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), but you're obviously a smart cookie and already knew that!

The initiation of this project and addition of prettier followed [this tutorial](https://paulintrognon.fr/blog/typescript-prettier-eslint-next-js).

This project is inspired by the Udemy course Junior to Senior Web Developer. I have added to it by including TS, prettier and CI to get a bit more practise with these techiques which have been covered elsewhere in the course.
